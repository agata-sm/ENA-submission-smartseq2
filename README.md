# Scripts for smartseq2 data submission to ENA


The process of data submission to ENA consists of two stages:

1. Sample registration

2. File submission

Scripts in directory `ENA_scripts_2021` have been used to perform these steps (as well as create the sample data sheet) in 2021. Please note the procedure may have changed since.

It is now (2026) possible to submit smartseq2 scRNA-seq data as unmapped `bam` file. File preparation as well the process are described in directory `smartseq2-bam`.
